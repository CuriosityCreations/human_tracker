% This is a function for evaluting object detectors. It computes:
%  the number of false positives (false_pos)
%  the number of true positives (num_detection)
%  the false positives percentage (perc_fp)
%  the number of false positives per frame (fppf)
%  the number of miss (miss)
%  the total number of people instances in the ground truth (num_people)
%  the miss percentage (perc_miss)
%  the number of miss per frame (mpf)
%  the false acceptance rate (FAR)
%  the false rejection rate (FRR)
%  the true acceptance rate (TAR)
%  the true rejection rate (TRR)
%  a false positive mask which points at false positives (false_pos_flag)
%
%  version 3: with Munkres algorithm to associate detections and ground
%  truth instances in a globally optimal way
